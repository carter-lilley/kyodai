class_name OverlayLayers
extends RefCounted

## Central registry of the canvas-layer stack. Higher layers render above
## lower ones. M3 addon components (M3Sheet, M3Dialog, M3Menu, M3Tooltip,
## M3Snackbar) carry their own defaults; these constants document the intended
## stack and are used wherever app code assigns or overrides a layer.
##
## Structural layers are reparented by DualScreenSubManager on DS mode shifts:
## UILayer (with its transition overlays) follows the main viewport, the
## on-screen keyboard moves to the second viewport. M3 overlays attach to
## whichever node is in the "m3_overlay_parent" group (see M3Overlay).
## ChromeLayer is NOT reparented: the window chrome only exists on the root
## window (desktop windowed mode), never on the Android dual-screen handheld.

## True while a mouse event lands on the window-chrome strip (the custom title
## bar at the top of the window). The chrome renders above every overlay and
## must stay clickable, so overlay _input handlers that blanket-consume events
## (transition overlays mid-animation) use this to let chrome clicks through.
